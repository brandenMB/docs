## Required tools

Theme uses [NPM](//www.npmjs.com/) as a front-end dependency manager and [Composer](//getcomposer.org/) as a back-end dependency manager. Make sure your development machine has installed following dependencies:

- [Node.js](//nodejs.org/)
- [NPM](//www.npmjs.com/)
- [Composer](//getcomposer.org/)

## Building a Theme

[Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) is used to compile and optimize theme's scripts, stylesheets, and images.

#### Resolving dependencies

Before being able to build theme you have to resolve required dependencies.

```bash
# @ wp-content/themes/<theme-name>

# Install composer dependencies.
$ composer install

# Install node dependencies.
$ npm install
```

Now you have all the packages necessary to run the build process and start developing your theme.

#### Building a Theme

There are a few available commands which help you to build the theme for different environments:

```bash
# @ wp-content/themes/<theme-name>

# Compiles unminified and unoptimized theme assets with source maps.
$ npm run development

# Alias for `development` command.
$ npm run dev

# Compiles minified and optimized theme assets without source maps.
$ npm run production

# Alias for `production` command.
$ npm run prod

# Builds assets for development, runs watcher (recompiles on change)
# and BroswerSync (refreshes browser).
$ npm run watch
```

## Handling project dependencies

### Front-end dependencies

All of the front-end packages necessary for your theme can be found in the `package.json`. Of course, you can specify and install other packages required by your project with [`npm install`](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/install) command or by adding additional fields to the `package.json` file.

```bash
# @ wp-content/themes/<theme-name>
npm install foundation-sites
```

Builder helps you also with importing third-party stylesheet libraries. Instead of referring path directly to the `node_modules/` directory, simply include it with `~` at the beginning. Builder will take care of it for you.

```scss
@import '~foundation-sites/scss/foundation';
```

Thanks to Babel you can use all of [ES6](https://babeljs.io/learn-es2015/) goodness. Especially, importing external scripts as modules.

```js
// ES6 Modules
import $ from 'jquery'
```

### Backend-end dependencies

The starter is configured to pull in Composerâ€™s autoload file. All you need to do is require the desired package.

```bash
# @ wp-content/themes/<theme-name>
composer require monolog/monolog
```

Afterward, it will be available inside every component of the project. Just import package namespaces and use it.

```php
use Monolog\Logger;
use Monolog\Handler\StreamHandler;
```

## Customizing build process

Builder rules and procedures are stored in the `build/` directory. Default settings of the builder are contained in a `webpack.config.js` and `app.config.js` files. These settings are extended with theme's `config/app.json` configuration file where you can easily overwrite defaults.

### Customizing assets filenames and output paths

You can control outputted names with environment variables in `.env` file. For example, we want to output our `.css` files inside a `styles` folder.

```json
FILENAME_CSS="styles/[name].css"
```

> Filenames have to use [Webpack placeholders](https://webpack.js.org/configuration/output/#output-filename) to determine asset name or extension.

Below you will find all available environment variables and used filenames placeholders

| Variable | Description | Default |
|---|---|---|
| `FILENAME_CSS` | Filename pattern for project stylesheet files | `'css/[name].css'` |
| `FILENAME_FONT` | Filename pattern for project font files | `'fonts/[name].[ext]'` |
| `FILENAME_IMAGE` | Filename pattern for project image files | `'images/[path][name].[ext]'` |
| `FILENAME_JAVASCRIPT` | Filename pattern for project javascript files | `'js/[name].js'` |
| `FILENAME_EXTERNAL_IMAGE` | Filename pattern for external dependencies image files | `'images/[name].[ext]'` |
| `FILENAME_EXTERNAL_FONT` | Filename pattern for external dependencies font files | `'fonts/[name].[ext]'` |

### Giving access to the global variables inside theme's scripts

To bypass conflicts with global variables, scripts outputted by Webpack are enclosed inside a scope. This force you to say explicitly which external variables you want inside theme scripts.

> By default, starter gives you access to the jQuery shipped with WordPress.

```json
{
  "externals": {
    "jquery": "jQuery"
  }
}
```

Simply add to the list new entry where the key is a name (under which external will be available) and the name of the global variable as value.

```json
{
  "externals": {
    "jquery": "jQuery",
    "backbone": "Backbone"
  }
}
```

Now, you can import this variable inside your theme scripts.

```js
import Backbone from 'backbone'
```
